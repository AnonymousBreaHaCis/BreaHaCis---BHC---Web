	<p>Welcome to the official site called BreaHaCis. (After installing the program) This message appears automatically when the date folder of the BreaHaCis software is created. A BHC-DATA folder has appeared on your C drive. Please, I ask you not to delete this folder. The folder stores your passwords and registration logins, as well as important parts of the program. If you delete this folder, the application may not start. And data can be deleted. But if you want to remove our program, do it through the uninstaller. This will delete all program data.</p>
